Enemies think player is still there when he dies due to the game object just being disabled... 

Ships cant fire when sheilds are down because they take all the energy

sometimes objects can go out of bounds. I don't know why

when player dies cameras stop tracking

when you warp home minimap does not reset.  -- fixed

wrap around stops working when you go back home. 

When you die you dont switch to small ship.

bullets don't stop working when they should cause of the death animation. they keep trynig to damage things...
